# BellmanFordAlgorithm

## Implementation of the Bellman Ford algorithm
This java code was developed during my master degree studies within a project team. 
It can be tested using the main method of the class `Example` in the src folder, where two examples are being into consideration .

In the package the is also the class `Graph` to be found, that implements a directed Graph.
