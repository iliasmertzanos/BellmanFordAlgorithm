# BellmanFordAlgorithm

## Implementation of the Bellman Ford algorithm
This java code was developed during my master degree studies within a project team. 
It can be tested using the main method of the class `Example` in the src folder, where two examples are being taken into consideration.

In the package the constructor of the class `BellmanFord` takes as argument a Graph an then initilizes two internal arrays:
- `private int[][] tree;`	
- `private double[][] U_n;` 

The class `Graph` is in the src folder to be found, which implements a directed Grap and doesn't allows parallel edges and self-loops.

For specific information see the source code comments. 
For german speakers see also the task description in the src folder.
